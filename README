The BRANCH software integrates MIT's SIMILE Timeline with the WordPress content management system, allowing points on an interactive timeline to be linked with articles published as WordPress pages.

BRANCH is an extension of Romanticism and Victorianism on the Net (RaVoN, http://ravonjournal.org). If you re-use the BRANCH software for a similar historical project, you are invited to contact RaVoN editor Dino Franco Felluga (felluga@purdue.edu), who is interested in knowing about related efforts.
